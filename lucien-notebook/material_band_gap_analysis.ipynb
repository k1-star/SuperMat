    "Lucien Notebook is configured to use your working directory as the base directory for all file operations. This means you can easily access files in your project:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# Read a file directly from your working directory\n",
    "with open('input.txt', 'r') as f:\n",
    "    content = f.read()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Write to a file in your working directory\n",
    "with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:\n",
    "    f.write('Hello, Lucien!')\n",
    "\n",
    "# List files in your working directory\n",
    "import os\n",
    "files = os.listdir('.')\n",
    "print(files)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use relative paths to access subdirectories:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Access files in subdirectories\n",
    "with open('subfolder/data.json', 'r') as f:\n",
    "    import json\n",
    "    data = json.load(f)\n",

    "> 💡 **Tip**: The notebook kernel is already configured to use your working directory as the current directory, so you can use simple relative paths without any additional setup.\n",
